# LibraryApp

At one point during the program, I struggled a little bit with database designs in PostgreSQL so I designed this project to challenge myself. I have currently built out all of the tables that I wanted and have started the process of writing my SQL queries in IntelliJ. The end goal for this project is to have an application where I, as a user, can have a library of all my books. I want to have the ability to view them based on whether or not they've been read yet and I want to be able to browse them based on things like genre and series. I'd also like to add a wishlist component to it so that I can keep track of books that I'm interested in purchasing and have it keep a running total of how much these books cost.
